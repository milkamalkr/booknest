Returns JSON list of books with owner and current renter names (joined from users table)

Paginate the results (limit, offset)

Sort results by title or date added

Use psycopg2 with RealDictCursor

Validates:
Book exists
User is not the owner of the book
User does not already have a rent request for this book (pending/accepted)
Inserts into rent_requests: book_id, renter_id, status = 'pending', request_date = NOW()

Also inserts into rental_history:
book_id, renter_id, status = 'pending', rented_by_owner_id = NULL, rent_start = NOW()
Uses psycopg2 and RealDictCursor
Is located in routers/books.py

Uses dependency get_current_user() for JWT user
Returns success or clear error if duplicate request exists

âœ… Write a FastAPI route /rent-requests/{id}/accept (PATCH)
Update /rent-requests/{id}/accept to:
Allow only the book owner to accept a request
Update the selected rent_request status to 'accepted'
Set the corresponding book.status = 'rented' and book.current_renter_id
Update the latest matching row in rental_history to status = 'rented'
If the user is in the waitlist for this book, remove the accepted user from waitlists for this book
Leave other users in waitlist and their requests as is
Set current_total of renter to current_total + book value

âœ… Prompt for /books/{id}/return (PATCH)

Implement a FastAPI route PATCH /books/{id}/return that:

Allows only the book owner (not admin, not renter) to mark the book as returned
Uses book_id from the URL and get_current_user() to identify the user
Connects to PostgreSQL using psycopg2 and RealDictCursor

Performs the following steps:
Fetch the book by id and validate it exists
Verify the current user is the owner of the book
Check that the book's current status is 'rented'
Set the book's status to 'available' and current_renter_id = NULL
Update the latest rental_history row for that book and renter:
Set status = 'returned'
Set rent_end = NOW()
Return a success message if update is successful, otherwise appropriate errors (e.g., 403, 404)
Place the route inside routers/books.py
Set current_total of renter to current_total - book value

Optionally log or simulate a notification to all users in the waitlists for that book


Write a FastAPI route GET /books/{id}/rent-cost that:

Allows only the book owner to access it
Uses book_id as a path parameter
Fetches the latest rental_history row for that book (ordered by rent_start DESC)
Joins books table to get rent_per_week
If rental_history.status = 'rented', use NOW() as rent_end
Calculates:
days = rent_end - rent_start
weeks = ceil(days / 7)
total_rent = weeks * rent_per_week
Returns:
{
  "book_id": "<uuid>",
  "renter_id": "<uuid>",
  "weeks": <int>,
  "total_rent": <int>,
  "status": "<rented|returned>",
  "days": <int>
}
Uses psycopg2 with RealDictCursor
Uses get_current_user() for JWT authentication and access check
Route should be placed in routers/books.py

Write a FastAPI route GET /rent-requests/my-outgoing that:

request_id
book_id
book_title
book_owner_id
status (pending, accepted, declined, returned)
request_date
Number of weeks requested: use rental_history.rent_start and rent_end or NOW() if still ongoing, then apply ceil(days / 7)
Orders the results by request_date descending
Uses psycopg2 with RealDictCursor
Implements route inside routers/rent_requests.py
Returns list of results in this format:
[
  {
    "request_id": "uuid",
    "book_id": "uuid",
    "book_title": "string",

Write a FastAPI route POST /books/{id}/waitlist that:

Adds the current authenticated user to the waitlist for a book
Uses book_id from the URL path
Uses a dependency get_current_user() to retrieve the authenticated user
Connects to PostgreSQL via psycopg2 with RealDictCursor
Validates that:
The book exists
The user is not already on the waitlist for the book
The user is not the owner of the book
Inserts a new record into the waitlists table with user_id, book_id, and created_at = NOW()
Calculates and returns the user's current position in the waitlist by ordering all waitlist entries for the book by created_at ASC
Returns a JSON response like:
{
  "book_id": "uuid",
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "position": 3,
  "message": "You have been added to the waitlist."
